0.2 (2010-10-31)
----------------
* renamed cgeo-openlayers css and included in css registry [gborelli]
* removed openlayers-macros [gborelli]
* Added CSS for definition lists within the framed cloud popups,
  as used in collective.geo.kml
  [rockdj] 
* Added ZCML registration for all skin subdirectories.  Without this,
  elements like the Edit toolbar don't appear when Plone isn't running
  in debug mode.
  [rockdj]
* Updated OpenLayers.js to 2.8 (+styles and resources)
* Register all browser pages and resources for IOpenLayers browser
  layer
* Removed geo-point.js in favour of editing features provided by OpenLayers
* Updated coordinate reference order to be consistent with WGS 1984 
  reference system.  This involves standardising the coordinate order
  to be [longitude, latitude] rather than [latitude, longitude].
  [rockdj]
* Gave the Map element a relative position via CSS to allow Plone 
  drop-down menus to appear over the top (z-index doesn't apply 
  unless position is specified).
  [rockdj]
* Added ZCML registration for 'img' and 'theme' skin subdirectories.
  Without registration, these folders are unable to be seen in Plone 
  and the OpenLayers controls don't appear. 
  [rockdj]
* Added unit tests to ensure skin subdirectory registration works.
